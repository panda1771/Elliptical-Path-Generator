# Elliptical Path Generator for Autonomous | FIRST Tech Challenge

This repository highlights a key algorithm within my school's FIRST Tech Challenge robotics team. This was the winning algorithm for the Control Award (2021), which was awarded to the team with the best control system across Southern California. I developed an algorithm that plots an elliptical trajectory for a robot to follow when given a start and final position. I used trigonometry and calculus to develop this algorithm, and was a vital part in our team's success during the autonomous section of our robot game.
